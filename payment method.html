                    <h3> Payment Agreement </h3>
                    <p>
                        This Payment Agreement is entered into as of [Date] by
                        and
                        between [Client.Company] having its principal place of
                        business located at [Client.Address] (the “Owing Party”)
                        and
                        [Sender.Company] having its principal place of business
                        located at [Sender.Address] (the “Owed Party”), both of
                        whom
                        agree to be bound by this Agreement.

                        WHEREAS, the Owing Party owes the Owed Party [Amount
                        owed]
                        (the “Deficiency”); and

                        WHEREAS, the Owing Party and the Owed Party desire to
                        enter
                        into an agreement whereby the Owing Party shall pay the
                        Owed
                        Party the sum of the Deficiency on a payment plan
                        according
                        to the terms and conditions herein.

                        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants
                        and
                        promises made by the parties hereto, the Owing Party and
                        the
                        Owed Party (individually, each a “Party” and
                        collectively,
                        the “Parties”) covenant and agree as follows: <br>

                        1. Deficiency Acknowledgment
                        The Owing Party agrees and acknowledges that it owes the
                        Owed Party an amount of money equal to the Deficiency as
                        defined above. Nothing in this Payment Agreement is a
                        waiver
                        of any amounts owed and in the event of any breach of
                        this
                        Agreement by the Owing Party, the Owed Party’s rights to
                        the
                        Deficiency shall not be limited. <br>

                        2. Owing Party Representation and Warranty
                        The Owing Party hereby represents and warrants that this
                        Agreement and the payment plan herein has been developed
                        in
                        a manner that that the Owing Party reasonably believes
                        it
                        can pay the Owed Party without further interruption
                        notwithstanding an additional change in circumstances.
                        <br>

                        3. Payment Plan
                        The Parties hereby agree to the payment plan as
                        described on
                        Exhibit A attached hereto (the “Payment Plan”). The
                        Owing
                        Party agrees to make the payments to the Owed Party
                        associated with the dates as listed on the Payment Plan.
                        <br>

                        4. Method of Payment
                        Payments shall be made to the Owed Party in accordance
                        with
                        the Payment Plan via [Payment method]. <br>

                        5. Release and Indemnification
                        In consideration for agreeing to this Payment Agreement,
                        the
                        Owed Party hereby releases any claims against the Owing
                        Party related to the Deficiency as of the date of this
                        Agreement. However, nothing in this Agreement is meant
                        to
                        release the Owing Party from its obligation to pay the
                        Deficiency according to the Payment Plan herein or limit
                        the
                        rights of the Owed Party in collecting said Deficiency.
                        <br>

                        6. Acceleration upon Breach
                        In the event that the Owing Party fails to make any
                        payments
                        in accordance with the Payment Plan, upon reaching ten
                        (10)
                        days after the failure to make any such prescribed
                        payment,
                        the full amount of the Deficiency shall come immediately
                        due
                        and payable. <br>

                        7. Assignment
                        The Owed Party may assign this Agreement with written
                        notice
                        to the Owing Party. In the event of such assignment, the
                        assignee may designate a new method of payment. <br>

                        8. No Modification Unless in Writing
                        No modification of this Agreement shall be valid unless
                        in
                        writing and agreed upon by both Parties. <br>

                        9. Severability
                        In the event any provision of this Agreement is held to
                        be
                        invalid, illegal, or enforceable for any reason, then
                        the
                        Parties agree that such provision shall be deemed to be
                        struck and the remainder of the Agreement shall be
                        enforced
                        as if the struck provision were never included in the
                        Agreement. <br>

                        10. Applicable Law
                        This Agreement and the interpretation of its terms shall
                        be
                        governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
                        the
                        State of [State] and subject to the exclusive
                        jurisdiction
                        of the federal and state courts located in [County],
